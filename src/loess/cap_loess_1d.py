# NAME:
#       LOESS_1D
# PURPOSE:
#       Local regression LOESS smoothing http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_regression
#       Univariate: Cleveland (1979) http://www.jstor.org/stable/2286407
#
# CALLING EXAMPLE:
#       xout, yout, wout = loess_1d(x, y, frac=0.5, degree=1, rotate=False)
#
# INPUT PARAMETERS:
#   X, Y: vectors of equal number of elements containing the coordinate X
#       and the corresponding function values Y to be smoothed.
#   XOUT: vector of X coordinates for the YOUT values (same size as Y).
#       If rotate=False (default) then XOUT = X.
#   YOUT: vector of smoothed Y values (same size as Y).
#   WOUT: vector of biweights used in the fit (same size as Y).
#
# KEYWORDS:
#   DEGREE: degree of the local approximation (typically 1 or 2)
#   FRAC: Fraction of points to consider in the local approximation.
#       Typical values are between ~0.2-0.8. Note that the values are
#       weighted by their distance from the point under consideration.
#       This implies that the effective fraction of points contributing
#       to a given value is much smaller that FRAC.
#   NPOINTS: Number of points to consider in the local approximation.
#       This is an alternative to giving FRAC=NPOINTS/n_elements(x).
#   ROTATE: Rotate the (X,Y) coordinates to make the X axis the axis
#       of maximum variance. This is useful to give comparable contribution
#       to the X and Y variables. It is mostly useful for testing.
#   SIGY: 1-sigma errors for the Y values. If this keyword is used
#       the biweight fit is done assuming those errors. If this keyword
#       is *not* used, the biweight fit determines the errors in Y
#       from the scatter of the neighbouring points.
#   WOUT: Output weights used in the fit. This can be used to
#       identify outliers: wout=0 for outliers deviations >4sigma.
#

#   V2.0.4: Converted from 2D to 1D. MC, Oxford, 23 February 2015
#   V2.0.5: Updated documentation. MC, Oxford, 26 March 2015
#   V2.0.6: Fixed deprecation warning in Numpy 1.11. MC, Oxford, 18 April 2016
#   V2.0.7: Allow polyfit_1d() to be called without errors/weights.
